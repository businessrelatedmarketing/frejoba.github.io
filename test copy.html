      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
      <p>
        Amazon Devices is an inventive research and development company that
        designs and engineers high-profile devices like the Kindle family of
        products. Amazon Devices began in 2004 as a subsidiary of Amazon.com,
        Inc. Since then, we have worked to produce best-selling e-readers and
        tablets, as well as new inventions like Fire TV and Echo. What will you
        help us create?<br />Work hard. Have fun. Make history.<br /><br />A day
        in the life<br />You own the day-to-day management of software
        development. You understand development methodologies (e.g., Scrum ) and
        work with your team to adopt the best approach to yield optimal team
        productivity, innovation potential, as well as fit the needs of the
        product being developed (for those working with hardware teams). You
        effectively prioritize deliverables. You stay connected and resolve
        blockers that could derail development schedules. You facilitate SDE
        connections to customers, Senior SDEs/Principal Engineers, and subject
        matter experts. You help your SDEs grow by encouraging them to
        contribute to cross-team technical discussions, supporting their ideas,
        and empowering them to make decisions. You partner effectively with TPMs
        and other supportive roles. You make sure both business and engineering
        requirements are well-defined. You are able to dive deeply into
        technical details (e.g., dependencies, design choices, operability) and
        can transform raw thoughts into clear direction. You partner with SDEs
        to scope development efforts and identify risks. You protect your team
        from being over-committed, recognizing that their ability to meet every
        expectation will at times be constrained. You proactively communicate
        priorities, development status, and any team challenges to customers,
        TPMs, stakeholders, and management. You ensure everyone is aware of how
        decisions are made and are notified when schedules change.<br />You have
        a solid understanding of the design approaches and industry technologies
        utilized within your team. You understand the overall architecture and
        foster great working relationships with any teams that share that
        architecture. You help make trade-offs; balancing the larger picture
        (e.g., resourcing, business goals, user experience, dependency impacts,
        efficiency, availability, etc.) against the needs of building,
        maintaining, refactoring, scaling, and extending features to properly
        support the life of the technology. You make sure your SDEs are able to
        spend adequate time on design and you seek their input on technology
        recommendations. In the absence of a Senior SDE, you are able to review
        software code (for style, readability, quality, and maintainability).
        You drive constructive technical discussions and audit appropriately to
        prevent the consequences of poor technology decisions. You are able to
        recognize when a proposed design is too complex or risky (and arrange
        for additional reviews with Senior/Principal Engineers).<br /><br />About

        enthusiastic Senior Software Development Engineer who is passionate
