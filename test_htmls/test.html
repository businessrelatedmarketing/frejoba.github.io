            >Azure Singularity team is looking for passionate engineers to build
            the largest deep-learning infrastructure service at Microsoft. In
            this role you will be tasked with building new components to bring
            the latest innovations in AI Infrastructure onto the Singularity
            platform. You will partner with top engineering talent within
            Singularity and across Azure to work on cluster orchestration, job
            scheduling, containerization and operating system integration. Your
            work will enable various AI languages and run-times on Singularity
            to bring distributed deep learning training and inferencing to life.
            In addition, you will build infrastructure components required to
            build, deploy, monitor and service highly available and scalable
            Microsoft Service Fabric and Kubernetes clusters under your care.
            You will lead development and customer support from the frontline
            and establish architecture, service excellence guidelines and a
            high-quality bar.</span

            takes AI to the unprecedented scale is an opportunity of a lifetime.

            >High scale AI workloads are always testing the limits of the
            infrastructure stack. Large-scale model training and inferencing
            with huge data volumes of training data on hundreds-thousands of
            GPUs make it a true engineering challenge. Singularity is a globally
            distributed, multi-tenant service that provides robust,
            cost-effective and competitive AI infrastructure (compute,
            networking and storage) for AI training and inferencing. By
            abstracting workloads from underlying infrastructure, Singularity
            creates a shared pool of resources that can be dynamically
            provisioned for full utilization of expensive GPU compute, and
            enabling data scientists to productively build, scale, experiment,
            and iterate their models on top of a robust, performant, scalable
            and cost-effective distributed infrastructure built for AI. In
            Singularity, we are constantly seeking to apply the best ideas from
            AI, ML, distributed systems, distributed databases, machine
            learning, information retrieval, networking, and security.</span
